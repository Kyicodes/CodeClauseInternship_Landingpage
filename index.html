    <section class="why">
        <h5>Why herbalism?</h5>
        <p>Learning herbalism can be a valuable pursuit for several reasons. Firstly, herbalism offers a deeper
            connection to
            nature and a holistic approach to well-being. By understanding the properties of various plants and herbs,
            individuals
            can harness their natural healing abilities, promoting physical, mental, and even spiritual health. This
            knowledge
            allows for the creation of personalized remedies, offering an alternative or complement to conventional
            medicine.
            <br>
            <br>
            Secondly, herbalism provides a sense of self-sufficiency and sustainability. Knowing how to identify,
            cultivate, and use
            herbs empowers individuals to take control of their health in a more natural and environmentally friendly
            way. With
            concerns about the environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and a growing interest in sustainable living,
            herbalism
            offers a path toward a healthier lifestyle that aligns with the principles of balance and harmony with the
            natural
            world.
